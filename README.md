# FelixBot

FelixBot is a basic Discord bot written on Python. It primarily functions as a bot to fetch astronomical data, pictures and sighting opportunities. FelixBot is stil *under* development and is constantly 
being updated, so watch out for new features!

Setting up the bot requires a unique Discord token that can be generated [here.](https://discord.com/developers/applications)

This bot is not being hosted currently by the creator, so users are requested to host it on their own.

For any requests/issues, please feel free to create an issue. Contributing to the projects through forks is also welcome.
