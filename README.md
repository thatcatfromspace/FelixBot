# FelixBot

**This project is no longer being maintained.** Due to changes in Discord's developer program and a few third party APIs being deprecated have rendered the project obsolete.  

FelixBot is a basic Discord bot written on Python. It primarily functions as a bot to fetch astronomical data, pictures and sighting opportunities. FelixBot is stil *under* development and is constantly 
being updated, so watch out for new features!

Setting up the bot requires a unique Discord token that can be generated [here.](https://discord.com/developers/applications) Users are recommended to store the bot token in an separate `.env` file in the same directory as the bot's files.

This bot is not being hosted currently by the creator, so users are requested to host it on their own. 

For any requests/issues, please feel free to create an issue. Contributing to the projects through forks is also welcome.
